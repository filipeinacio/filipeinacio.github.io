Taking on the role of an engineering manager is a significant career step, and your first round of 1:1 meetings can set the tone for your relationships with your team, your manager, and your manager's manager (skip level). To ensure these meetings are productive and engaging, it’s crucial to ask the right questions from three key perspectives: **1:1 upward**, **1:1 upward skip level**, and **1:1 downward**. Here’s a guide to the essential questions you should ask during each of these initial meetings.

## 1:1 Upward: Connecting with Your Direct Manager

The 1:1 with your direct manager is a critical opportunity to align on expectations, understand the broader vision, and establish a foundation of trust. Here are the top questions to ask:

### a. What are your expectations of me in the first 90 days?
Understanding what your manager expects from you will help you prioritize your efforts and set the right goals. It will also give you a clear idea of what success looks like in the early stages of your role.

### b. How do you prefer to receive updates and communicate?
Every manager has a preferred communication style, whether it’s regular updates via email, Slack, or more frequent face-to-face discussions. Clarifying this early on ensures that you’re on the same page and can tailor your communication accordingly.

### c. What are the biggest challenges or opportunities for the team right now?
This question shows your initiative and desire to contribute effectively. It also helps you identify key areas where you can make an immediate impact.

### d. How can I support you and the broader team's goals?
By asking this, you demonstrate a collaborative mindset. It also opens up a discussion about how your work can align with the broader organizational objectives.

### e. Are there any key stakeholders I should build relationships with?
Networking is crucial for your success as a manager. Understanding which stakeholders are important will help you build the right connections early on.

## 1:1 Upward Skip Level: Building a Relationship with Your Manager’s Manager

A 1:1 with your manager’s manager, often referred to as a skip-level meeting, is an opportunity to gain insight into the company’s broader strategy and to ensure your work aligns with higher-level goals. Here’s what to ask:

### a. What are your strategic priorities for the department in the next 6-12 months?
This question helps you understand the larger goals and challenges facing your department. It’s important to know how your work and your team’s efforts contribute to these priorities.

### b. How do you see the engineering team evolving in the near future?
Understanding the vision for the team’s growth and evolution will help you align your management approach with future needs. It also gives you insight into potential opportunities or risks.

### c. What qualities do you value most in the leaders within your organization?
This is a great way to understand what leadership traits are prized within the company. It can also guide your development as a leader in a way that aligns with the company culture.

### d. How do you perceive the team’s current performance, and where do you see room for improvement?
Gaining an external perspective on your team’s performance can be incredibly valuable. It allows you to understand how others view your team and where there may be gaps or opportunities for growth.

### e. Are there any upcoming projects or initiatives I should be aware of?
This shows your interest in staying ahead of the curve and ensures that you’re not blindsided by upcoming changes. It also allows you to prepare your team for any new challenges or opportunities.

## 1:1 Downward: Engaging with Your Direct Reports

Your 1:1s with direct reports are where you’ll build the foundation of your leadership. These meetings are crucial for establishing trust, understanding your team’s needs, and ensuring everyone is aligned. Consider asking the following:

### a. What are your personal and professional goals? How can I support them?
Understanding what motivates your direct reports is key to being an effective leader. By aligning their personal growth with team objectives, you can foster a more engaged and productive team.

### b. What are the biggest challenges you’re facing in your role?
This question allows you to identify any obstacles that might be hindering your team’s performance. It also shows that you’re interested in their well-being and success.

### c. How do you prefer to receive feedback and recognition?
Every individual is different in how they like to be recognized and how they respond to feedback. Tailoring your approach to each person will make your feedback more effective.

### d. What would make your work here more enjoyable or fulfilling?
This question can uncover opportunities to improve team morale and job satisfaction. It also signals that you care about their happiness, not just their output.

### e. How can I improve as your manager?
Asking for feedback on your management style shows humility and a commitment to continuous improvement. It also sets a precedent for open communication.

## Conclusion

Your first round of 1:1 meetings as an engineering manager is a pivotal moment to establish strong relationships, set clear expectations, and gain insight into your team’s dynamics and organizational priorities. By asking thoughtful questions from the perspectives of upward, upward skip-level, and downward 1:1s, you set the stage for a successful tenure in your new role. Remember, the goal of these meetings is not just to gather information but to build trust and open lines of communication that will be crucial to your success as a leader.
