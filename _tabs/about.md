I thrive in dynamic environments that blend technological innovation with strategic business growth, particularly within the tech industry.

## My Journey

Beginning my career in Lisbon, Portugal, I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Instituto Politécnico de Beja in 2006. I quickly embraced professional challenges that harnessed my technical skills and leadership capabilities. Over the years, I have served in various roles, from Junior Software Engineer at SADCI - Consulting Services to Engineering Lead at Farfetch, one of the global leaders in the luxury fashion industry.

At Farfetch, I led a team of talented backend engineers, focusing on enhancing our product catalog integration with both external partners like Google Merchant Center, ProductsUp, Kevel, BazaarVoice and internal teams. This role honed my ability to manage cross-functional team collaborations, mentor budding engineering talent, and drive projects that scale business operations through advanced microservices architectures.
